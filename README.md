Repository for the commence chart seating team contract.

Team Contract 

A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed BEFORE starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records.  This document is more for your group than it is for me so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

Team Structure: 

Leadership structure (individual, individual with rotating leadership, shared):  

Leadership will be shared amongst each other.  

Noah will be the general organizer and leader. 

 

 

 

Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?):  

 

At the end of the day, everyone in the group needs to agree on a decision and hold true to it. 

Compromises are completely allowed, to where if a particular set of people get their way this time, then the other set gets their way next time.  

We will use documentation for this, to where it is agreed upon what one party will get, and what the other party will receive. 

No mob rule, a 2 to 1 vote does not make decisions. Unanimous decisions or compromise are allowed. 

  

 

 

 

Who is the team Recorder/Documentation Manager/Maintainer of all required turn-ins?  

Noah Chaffin will be the recorder/documentation manager/maintainer. 

 

 

 

 

Day, time, and place for regular team meetings:  

Sunday around 7 p.m. 

Wednesday nights, around 7 p.m.  

This can always be arranged if there is a need for a schedule change for the meetings. 

  

 

 

 

Usual method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, wired phone, in person):  

 

Our first method of communication will always be through teams, via our group chat.  

If there is ever an emergency concerning the project, calling and texting is allowed. 

Team Procedures: 

Method for setting and following meeting agendas (Who will set each agenda? When? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting?):  

Any team member can suggest a meeting within a set time.   

If not all members can attend, then they will be briefed on what happened during that meeting.  

Everyone is going to play a part in the agendas. The team member with sole responsibility of a certain aspect of the project has the first say of when that deadline is, and the other two members are allowed to discuss it with them. 

We will meet twice a week, at least. 

 

 

 

 

Method of record keeping (Who will be responsible for recording and disseminating minutes? How and when will the minutes be disseminated? Where will all agendas and minutes be stored?):  

 

Each person will be responsible for keeping track of their own time.  

Agendas will be stored on a group document in word.  

Client meetings will be audio recorded with their consent.  

We will use word documents to keep track of client conversations, and those will be on a master document.  

We will also document our progress during our meetings. 

 

 

 

 

Procedures in the absence of a team member: (will the team meet with one member absent, or must all members be present?):   

The reality is that some meetings will have to take place without all members physically there.  

In this case, we will attempt to meet over teams, but if that is not possible as well, a two-person meeting will commence, where the person who was absent is briefed on what occurred. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Team Participation: 

Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:  

We will have consistent meetings throughout the week, and we will rearrange tasks as necessary. We will try to work towards each group memberâ€™s strengths and interests. 

 

 

 

 

Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance):  

We will set goals at each meeting we are at, and at the next meeting we will check to see if we achieved those goals. In the case we do not complete our set goal(s), we will troubleshoot and figure out why that goal was not achieved and set a new deadline. 

 

 

 

 

Personal Accountability: 

Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings:  

This is a professional project that has people depending on us. Participation from everyone involved in the team will be necessary, and everyone within the team will hold other members accountable. We need to attend every meeting on time to get as much value as possible each time we are together, whether it is to discuss progress, or to work in a group.  

This is obvious, but everyone must come to class as often as possible. 

 

 

 

 

Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:  

 

 

While this contract has been strict thus far, this is a first-time project for many people in this group, and we will not have perfect deadlines all the time. Sometimes, we will overestimate and underestimate ourselves, and we can discuss the rearrangement of deadlines during those meetings.  

Of course, we will have set deadlines. This holds everyone accountable and gives us a great idea have how we are progressing.   

Expected level of communication with other team members: 

There is a high expectation of communication within our team. We will be very active in our group chat and meetings, even if everything is going well. 

 

 

 

 

 

Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks.  

This is an all-in project. If the team decides on something, everyone is on board with that decision. 

 

 

 

 

 

Consequences of breach of contract: 

 

 

Policies for handling infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:  

Talk it over with the group member to make sure this is not a reoccurring issue.   

 

 

 

 

Policies for handling persistent infractions:   

Reporting to Doctor Goadrich, and an unfavorable peer review. 

Contract Amendments:  

This contract can be amended with the signature and agreement of all members of this team, Noah Chaffin, Colten Berry, and Ian Walker.
