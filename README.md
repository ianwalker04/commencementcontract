Repository for the commence chart seating team contract.

Team Contract 

A Team Contract is a document prepared by each team prior to starting work on group projects. Students should be held accountable and responsible for their own actions. Students will develop their own "rules of engagement" through development of a Team Contract. This contract provides an opportunity for your group to specify preferred methods of communication, action plans, meeting schedules, goals, and consequences of actions (or inactions) of group members. The contract should be developed and signed BEFORE starting the actual course project. For the Team Contract to be valid, provide the signed and dated original contract to me by the specified deadline on your course schedule. Give a photocopy of the original to each group member for their records.  This document is more for your group than it is for me so feel free to tailor it to your group's needs.

Team Structure: 

Leadership structure (individual, individual with rotating leadership, shared):  

Leadership will be shared amongst each other.  

Noah will be the general organizer and leader. 

 

 

 

Decision-making policy (by consensus? by majority vote?):  

 

At the end of the day, everyone in the group needs to agree on a decision and hold true to it. 

Compromises are completely allowed, to where if a particular set of people get their way this time, then the other set gets their way next time.  

We will use documentation for this, to where it is agreed upon what one party will get, and what the other party will receive. 

No mob rule, a 2 to 1 vote does not make decisions. Unanimous decisions or compromise are allowed.
